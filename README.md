# NLP Text Classification with Streamlit
This repository contains a Streamlit app that demonstrates how to build a text classification model using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The text classification model is used to predict the category of a text document based on the text content.

**Dataset**   <br>
The dataset used in this project is a public dataset of news articles, containing text documents from several categories such as sports, technology, and politics. The dataset is split into a training set and a test set, with the training set used to train the text classification model and the test set used to evaluate the performance of the model.

**NLP Text Classification Model**   <br>
The NLP text classification model used in this project is a supervised learning model that learns to predict the category of a text document based on the text content. The model is trained on the training set using several NLP techniques, including tokenization, stemming, stop-word removal, and vectorization. The performance of the model is evaluated on the test set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Streamlit App**   <br>
The Streamlit app in this project provides a user interface for interacting with the NLP text classification model. The app allows users to input text documents and see the predicted category of the document. The app also includes several visualizations to help users understand the performance of the model, including a confusion matrix and a ROC curve.

**Conclusion**   <br>
This Streamlit app provides a powerful tool for text classification using NLP techniques. The app is based on a supervised learning model that learns to predict the category of a text document based on the text content. The app includes several NLP techniques, including tokenization, stemming, stop-word removal, and vectorization, to improve the predictive power of the model. The app also includes several visualizations to help users understand the performance of the model. By using this app, users can classify text documents into categories, helping businesses understand customer sentiment, predict user behavior, and improve customer satisfaction.
